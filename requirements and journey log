Tech requirements

Languages - Python, javascript, html/css

Technologies - Google Gemini, Flask, pinecone, google cloud services, llama_index stuff

Design unknowns/challenges - Google cloud services, front end development, I have a whole ass football game at 11am tomorrow

Design to do:
1. find technologies and requirements - in progress
2. research and play with unknown tech (google cloud services)
2. begin by making a poc
3. begin building front end
4. fully flesh out a MVP
5. present


10:15 4/12 - need to get home i have a football game tomorrow
    got google drive and docs linked through google cloud api services, hopefully i dont break it in developing more stuff. 
    scrapetext.py now scrapes the first 10 docs in your google doc account and displays it to the console. One step away from 
    turning those words into vectors to store into pinecone.

    This hardest step so far as been taken, the rest will be smooth and steady until i begin work on the UI
